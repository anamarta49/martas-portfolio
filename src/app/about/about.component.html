    <p>With over <strong>{{yearsOfExperience}}</strong> years of experience in the field, I pride myself in delivering efficient and creative <strong>Frontend</strong> technical solutions. 
      My journey has equipped me with a fluent understanding of modern frameworks and agile methodologies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my work is in <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong> applications, with the help of tools like <strong>PrimeNG</strong>, <strong>Jest</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.
      But I'm always eager to tackle new projects and learn new tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in teamwork and love seeing a project take shape through collective effort.
